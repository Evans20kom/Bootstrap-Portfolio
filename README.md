# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description
The challenge for week 3 of the Front-End Bootcamp

The website was put together in the specifications of the previous challenge, while using bootstrap 4.6 to introduce responsive elements.

The website will serve as a portfolio in the future; it currently includes placeholders that will be covered by future projects, and it is expected to showcase my developer skills to prospective employers.

I have been able to use a number of bootstrap 4.6 classes and features to create a responsive website. The use of bootstrap, in conjunction with custom .css elements, has highlighted how classes need to be selected in the .css files in order to override the original styling of boostrap framework.

A number of code placeholders were left in the code for this project: work to be continued on custom fonts and future development ideas.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The website has few elements that directly showcase my profile as a prospective developer:

    ```
### Navbar and Hero Section (Jumbotron)

The navbar contains links to the page sections, and placeholders for future links to activate.

In addition, there is a language selector dropdown list to link to a translated page to Greek (future addition).

The Hero section contains the photo of the developer and a headline, alongside a placeholder text for future development.

### Card Elements

The card elements are placeholders for future projects. The buttons will include the name of the project with the technologies learnt when developing it.

### Footer / Contact Details

The footer contains the contact details of the developer, with a hover effect, in accordance with the specifications of the assignment. Actual links to existing contact methods have been included, and placeholder links have been added for future additions.
